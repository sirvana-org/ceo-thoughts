# What we do

Melian organizes the world's products.

We aggregate every single product from every single e-commerce site and marketplace on the web into one AI-powered shopping platform. Find any product available online without opening multiple tabs or being limited to just a few vendors, sellers, or brands.

Online shopping is stuck in the Yahoo Directory era. You know what you want but not where to find it. You open dozens of tabs, take screenshots, compare prices across sites, and still miss products because they're scattered across the web. We're building the Google Search for shopping - one place to find everything.

## About
We started in Argentina at 17 years old. Built an MVP. Got users. Raised $2.1M from Hi Ventures, Guillermo Rauch (Vercel), and Damian Schenkelman (Auth0). Changed our name from Sirvana to Melian. Now we're in SF building the future of shopping.

The app lets you add any store, and we'll fetch all their products into your personalized feed. Search across everything in one place. No more tab chaos.

We processed over 1 million searches and became the #3 most downloaded shopping app on our first day of 2025.
